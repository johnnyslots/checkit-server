CheckIt is a mobile app that allows you to send and receive recommendations for content such as books, movies, podcasts, and more. You can keep track of who recommended what and when, and manage your lists so that you know which book to read or movie to watch next. The app is built using React Native, socket.io, Node, and Express.
